> ## You might notice that all product images are the same
This is because of how the img source in been rendered, during development 
I realized the img url provided from the response data, does not render an image in the component 
> ImageCell.tsx

rather it breaks, so for a better user experience, I added a conditional fallback
to render a static image, using this code in the ImageCell.tsx
```typescript
   const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(TableImage);

   useEffect(() => {
		const img = new Image();
		img.src = value;

		img.onload = () => setImgSrc(value);
		img.onerror = () => setImgSrc(TableImage);

		return () => {
			img.onload = null;
			img.onerror = null;
		};
	}, [value]);
```

> Note ‚ÄºÔ∏è, If you try to visit the production build here: 
https://unlimi-one.vercel.app/
It will throw an error with this warning in the console
```bash
index-f5d6d3b6.js:179 Mixed Content: The page at 'https://unlimi-one.vercel.app/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://3.88.1.181:8000/products/public/catalog?supplier=FragranceX'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```
This is because the data is fetched from an insecure HTTP source.
